This is the Hero Lab user file for the 1930's call of shadows campaign. 

Feel free to use it in your shadowrun 5e / call of cthulhu (7E) crossover games.

This mod includes the following:

	- Skills - I've added the skill list from Call Of Cthulhu 7E where there is no matching skill in SR5. You will not be a shadowrunner in the 1930's. As such, some of the general weapon skills from SR shouldn't be used. 

	- Gear - I've added the gear, including weapons and armor, from Call of Cthulhu 7E as well. I used their prices to establish the costs and ammunition counts for the various pieces of equipment. For some of the weapon descriptions, I used wikipedia. To find 1930's specific gear, enter 1930's into the search bar

	- Attribute Tests - I've added two attribute tests. Sanity and Idea. Sanity is derived from Willpower + Essence. Idea is Intuition + Logic.  Idea checks are for characters who are in an unfamiliar situation and trying to puzzle through it. If they are unable, they can try to roll against an idea threshhold. If they fail, they figure it out wrong, if they succeed, they figure it out right. Usually. GM discretion. Idea checks can also be used to bypass Sanity checks. Sanity is used to resist sanity loss events. When characters encounter terrible creatures, they should resist a sanity loss value with the sanity check roll. This represents their mental capacity to handle the strange and unusual. 

	- Trackers - I've added three trackers.
		- Cthulhu Mythos - This tracker cannot be decreased. It tracks the sanity draining knowledge of what you have learned from the other side. Cthulhu Mythos value decreases the maximum sanity of your Sanity tracker.
		- Lost Sanity - The Lost Sanity tracker is used to track the amount of sanity lost by a character. Increase the tracker to lose sanity, decrease the tracker to heal sanity. If you heal more sanity than you lost, the tracker is able to go negative.
		- Sanity - The Sanity tracker is used to track the characters mental reserve. When they lose too much sanity at once, the GM needs to apply temporary or permanent insanities (to-do) to those characters.
